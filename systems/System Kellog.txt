Be alert Captain, Kellog system is near Van-dool territory. System wide insurance value is 6 - insurance claims would probably be at a loss here, should we run into trouble. There are 6 planetary objects in this system. 2 planets have detailed entries: Kellog 2, commonly called "Ziss", and Kellog 6 called "quarter deck".  Kellog 2, is a lush jungle world. The other notable planet, The other planets, Kellog 1, 3, 4 and 5, are off limits for exploring or mining, due to Ziss's developing world status. Quarterdeck is a prison world, and Ziss is banned for legitimate travel for being a developing world.
