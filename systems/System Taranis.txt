teh-raniss is best known as one of the systems of Kellar’s Run, and is used by ships looking to avoid the pirate warrens of the Nexus system. Unfortunately the jump-points in the teh-raniss system are located near the third planet and a substantial debris field. It was discovered in twenty-four-oh-one by the famous U.E.N. survey ship... Mythic Horizon. The system poses no real strategic value to the military and the mediocre mining potential of the system is offset by the dangerous asteroid fields. There is a plaque located near the landing zone on teh-raniss III eulogizing the crew of one of the Mythic's survey boats which was destroyed by a meteor strike during the initial survey of the system. Additionally, this system is also home to the real-world location embodied in Origin's Arena Commander game. teh-raniss II is the Broken Moon.
