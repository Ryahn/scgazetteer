teh-rahniss II was a candidate for terra-forming, however over-zealous corporation CRABSOS inc., shattered the moons of teh-rahniss II due to a perfect storm of sub-standard terra-forming equipment and the use of near-slave-labor. Several of the terra-forming stacks also malfunctioned and are unable to shut down. Pilots are cautioned to steer clear of the stack beams as the gravimetric anomaly generated by the beam can suck ships into them with deadly consequences.
