Kellog 2, Ziss, is an explorers paradise that showed signs of indigenous intelligent life and new medicines. Captain, You should know that the U.E.E. subcommittee for Development and Expansion has banned all travel to Ziss, to cut down contamination and off-world interference. Landing on the planet would require stealth options to avoid harming your citizen rating. However Captain, data shows that destroyer squadrons rarely patrol this system should you wish to investigate. The black market for biological goods on Kellog 2 is quite high. Of small note: Ziss is from where the "Flow-pets" came, that were desirous back on earth several years ago. These creatures are no longer being traded. It was, as you say, a fad.
